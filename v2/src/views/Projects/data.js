    "Not wanting to lose sleep and wake up too early, I started development on Rise. In the Rise app, you simply add tasks for each day, fill out a profile which will contain your commute route, transportation mode, and arrival time.",
    "Rise will calculate your commute time, accounting for usual traffic conditions that day and time, and your tasks, to produce your wake up. After you wake up, gentle reminders to stay on track with your morning routine. This will result in maximum sleep time, less morning panic, best of all get to work on time.",
